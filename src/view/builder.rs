/// Builders are required to build and update views
///
/// This is a simple trait that 'binds' two types together -- a cheap builder and a view.
///
/// When the UI creates or updates a view, this builder gets passed to it.
///
/// When the user wants to show a view, they can pass its builder to
/// [`ui.show()`](Ui::show) or [`ui.show_children()`](Ui::show_children)
///
/// ### Note on the `'v` lifetime.
/// This lifetime is provided but you don't have to
/// use it. If you borrow any data from the application, it must conform to this
/// 'v lifetime. Views cannot borrow data as they must be 'static
///
/// ### Builders can also be views

/// // views must be `Debug`, builders don't have to be
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// struct Foo;
///
/// impl<'v> Builder<'v> for Foo {
///     type View = Self; // we cannot borrow anything for 'v because a View must be 'static

///         // args here is 'Self'
